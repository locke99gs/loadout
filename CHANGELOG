Loadout (in C!), by Dusten Barker
---------------------------------
Fuck with this code before I license it
and I'll hit you in your filfthy face.

v0.2 - 25sep11 - "Clear Water"
	-Previous versions were bash scripts
	-Cause v0.1 stalls at loads ~10*corecount
	-Cause bash doesn't do fractional maths with built-ins or core-utils.
	-Cause this kickassery spawns one process vs a bajillion.
	-Cause I'm awesome, bored, and this is the sex.
	*5k for command line argument and sanity testing. Fuck.

v0.2.1 - 25sep11 - "More Beef"
	+Added signal handling
	*Signal handling increases binary size ~200 bytes.
v0.2.2 - 26sep11 - "Horror Machine"
	+Can now redirect output on command line
	-Put errors on stderr
	+Can now set delay
	+Can now display date, with configurable date output.
	*Surpasses feature parity with v0.1 bash script
	*POSIX compliant, cause I'm amazing
	+Add counter for up, down, and show or not.
	+Add rudimentary IOwait colorized output
		-I think my math works. Will have to run by somebody.
		-Also not sure about the colors I used here. Good guess.
	*And to wrap up, 0 compile warnings with -Wall.
